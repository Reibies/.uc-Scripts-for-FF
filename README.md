## JS

[**Rights to close**](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Reibies/.uc-Scripts-for-FF/main/js/Rights%20to%20close.uc.js)
> This is a userchrome script that allows you to double right click anywhere on a page to close the current tab

[**Custom tab in about:pref**](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Reibies/.uc-Scripts-for-FF/main/js/about%20pref%20Newtab.uc.js)
> There are a lot of these but I wanted to paste it into about:preference#home

## CSS

[**Favicon tabs**](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Reibies/.uc-Scripts-for-FF/main/css/%5BFavicon%20Tabs%5D.css)
> Reduces tabs to a purely favicon state

[**Navbar autohide**](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Reibies/.uc-Scripts-for-FF/main/css/%5BNavbar%20autohide%5D.css)
> This css autohides the navbar until you hover over the toolbar area above it like the tabs
